        <div>Weird is awesome. Why be normal when you can be yourself? You know, when my friends finally stopped saying "that's so weird!" and started saying, "That's just PerAda." That was the day I knew you shouldn't change the parts you love about yourself for someone else. You will find your people.</div>
